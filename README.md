The document describes a project on web and social network analytics, where the aim was to analyze the potential of three marketing campaigns run by a hypothetical company. The dataset consists of 160,000 rows, each corresponding to a different visit to a website and its clickstream. Each row also has corresponding ‘origin’ and ‘platform’ info. The data is presented in a CSV file with two columns: the first indicates the origin and the second indicates the platform. The remaining columns to the right indicate the pages the user visited.

The project is carried out using Python, and the working file is a Jupyter notebook. All codes and explanations, along with the dataset, are present in the author's GitHub repository. The repository can be used as a resource for anyone looking to carry out similar projects on web and social network analytics.
